# Sh_Kahoot-multi-account-bot ( Kahoot Bot )

This Shell script allows you to manage multiple kahoot users in the same browser's window (to answer the questions at the same time with all of them).

It features a full in-terminal interface, a function to answer the question given by the user (with the mouse as usual) to all the defined accounts. It also contains a autoSetup fucntion to open browser and set the kahoot users with a kahoot-id and a name.

It works with as many accounts as the browser can handle. The number, as well as the rest of the parameters, can be changed using the interface.

**Check the help section in the interface before executing the first time.**

This script uses xdotool to control the users device.
